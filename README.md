# LinearRegression

Linear regression model I developed from scratch using python in preperation for summer 2019 internship. 

**REQUIREMENTS**

 - Python 3 installed
 - Virtual Env package installed

**TO USE**
 1. Clone repository
 2. Run `source venv/bin/activate` in the projects root 
 3. Run `python ExampleData.py`

See "LinearRegression.py" for source functions. (NOTE: this is not Scikit-Learn, the functionality is VERY bare-bones)

See "ExampleData.py" file on how to use.

"Notes.pdf" are my notes on the subject

"data_set_example.csv" is data **CREATED** for this specific project and does **NOT** represent real statistics.
