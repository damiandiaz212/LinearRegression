# LinearRegression

Linear regression model I developed from scratch using python in preperation for summer 2019 internship. 

See "LinearRegression.py" for source functions. (NOTE: this is not Scikit-Learn, the functionality is VERY bare-bones)

See "ExampleData.py" file on how to use.

"Notes.JPG" are my notes on the subject

"data_set_example.csv" is data **CREATED** for this specific project and does **NOT** represent real statistics.
